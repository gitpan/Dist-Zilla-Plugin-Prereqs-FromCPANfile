NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::FromCPANfile - Parse cpanfile for prereqs

SYNOPSIS
      # dist.ini
      [Prereqs::FromCPANfile]

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::FromCPANfile is a Dist::Zilla plugin to
    read *cpanfile* to determine prerequisites for your distribution. This
    does the opposite of what Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CPANFile does, which is
    to *create* a "cpanfile" using the prereqs collected elsewhere.

    DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN IN COMBINATION WITH Plugin::CPANFile. You will
    probably be complained about creating duplicate files from dzil.
